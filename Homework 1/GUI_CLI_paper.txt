A CLI, or Command Line Interface, lets you input commands to interact with the operating system. 

GUI, or Graphical User Interface, gives users graphics to make it easier to interact with the operating system. 

GUI has menus, images, videos, text, and you can use a mouse to interact with things. 

CLI is faster, and more precise.
