Graphics User Interface, or GUI, uses menus and other visual elements to make it easier for users to interact with applications and/or electronic devices. Files and folders can be moved around and clicked. It is easier to understand than CLI, but it is less precise and slower. CLI stands for the Command-line Interface. It allows a user to do everything they can with the GUI and more. It uses text-only commands. It displays more information than GUI and lets the user manipulate files faster.
