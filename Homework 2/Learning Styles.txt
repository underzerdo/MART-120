My learning style result said:
30% visual
30% auditory
40% kinesthetic

I think the quiz is a little weird and does make sense in some places. Everyone learns differently and is more complex than just 3 styles. The quiz specifically will give you auditory if you enjoy listening to music for example. I think I need to do something to learn it, so I should fit under kinesthetic.
